## *Latest News* 🔥

- **[2026/07]** Claude Opus 5 / Sonnet 5 upgrade — Planner on Opus 5 with adaptive thinking, Coordinator on Haiku 4.5, all other agents on Sonnet 5. Sampling parameters now go only to the older families that still accept them.
- **[2026/06]** Data Q&A — the **inner loop** to analysis's outer loop: natural-language chat over the uploaded CSV with DuckDB Text2SQL, sandboxed in-process (no data leaves your AWS account), Bedrock prompt caching for ~90% input-token savings on multi-turn dialogue, and an inline SQL editor so analysts can inspect, edit, and re-run the generated SQL without another LLM call. ([details](./deep-insight-web/DATA_QA.md))
- **[2026/05]** Citation integrity validation — every number cited in a report is re-verified and linked to its calculation via `[N]` markers, with an independent Auditor (DeepTRACE A/B/C/D) blocking unverified or hallucinated figures (self-hosted + managed) ([details](./docs/features/data-validation/citation-validation-explained.md))
- **[2026/04]** Auto-generate sample analysis prompts — AI generates 3 sample prompts (간단/중간/복잡 — simple/medium/complex) from your column-definitions JSON, replacing the previous hard-coded fallback chips. Each generated prompt references actual column names so it's immediately runnable. ([details](./docs/features/prompt-generation/README.md))
- **[2026/04]** Auto-generate column definitions — AI builds `column_definitions.json` from a CSV header + sample rows, removing the manual JSON-authoring barrier for non-technical users. Includes a Table/JSON review panel with manual edit support. ([details](./docs/features/json-generation/README.md))
- **[2026/04]** CloudFront + Cognito deployment option for Web UI — HTTPS with Lambda@Edge authentication for external demos and customer PoCs ([details](./deep-insight-web/README.md))
- **[2026/03]** Ops Dashboard - job tracking, email notifications, and admin dashboard with Cognito authentication ([details](./deep-insight-web/ops/README.md))
- **[2026/02]** Web UI (v1.1.0) - browser-based interface for data upload, analysis, HITL plan review, and report download ([details](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-deep-insight/blob/main/deep-insight-web/README.md))

## Are You Facing These Challenges?

### 에이전트 설계, 어디서부터 시작해야 할지 고민이신가요? (Struggling with Agent Architecture?)

Deep Insight provides a **proven hierarchical architecture** with Coordinator, Planner, Supervisor, and specialized tool agents. Start with a working production-grade system and customize from there—no need to design from scratch.

### 프로덕션급 성능의 에이전트, 어떻게 만들어야 할지 막막하신가요? (Need Production-Grade Performance?)

Get **production-grade multi-agent workflows** out of the box with prompt caching, streaming responses, token tracking, and battle-tested performance patterns. Deploy with confidence using architecture validated in real-world scenarios.

### 민감한 데이터를 안전하게 처리하고 싶으신가요? (Concerned About Data Security?)

Deploy Deep Insight in **your own AWS VPC** for complete data isolation and control. All data processing happens within your secure VPC environment, with Amazon Bedrock API calls staying in AWS infrastructure—never exposed to the public internet.

## Why Deep Insight?

Transform complex data analysis into automated insights using hierarchical multi-agent systems built on Strands SDK and Amazon Bedrock.

- **🤖 Advanced Multi-Agent Architecture** - Hierarchical workflow with Coordinator, Planner, Supervisor, and specialized tool agents
- **🎨 Full Customization & Control** - Modify agents, prompts, and workflows with complete code access
- **🧠 Flexible Model Selection** - Choose different Claude models for each agent (Sonnet 4, Haiku 4, etc.) via simple .env configuration
- **💻 Custom Code Interpreter** - Flexible code execution from local Python to Fargate-based containers with your own Docker image
- **📊 Transparency & Verifiability** - Reports with calculation methods, sources, and reasoning processes
- **🔒 Enterprise-Grade Security** - From local development to 100% private VPC with Bedrock AgentCore Runtime
- **⚡ Production Scalability** - Concurrent processing with AgentCore MicroVM and auto-scaling Fargate containers
- **🚀 Beyond Reporting** - Extend to any agent use case: shopping, support, log analysis, and more

## Quick Start

Deep Insight provides three deployment options to match your needs.

### Self-Hosted Deployment

Run agents locally or in your VPC with full control:
- ✅ Complete code access to agents, prompts, and workflows
- ✅ Rapid iteration during development (no rebuild required)
- ✅ Simple setup in ~10 minutes

**Get Started**: [`./self-hosted/`](./self-hosted/) | 📖 [Self-Hosted README](./self-hosted/README.md)

### Managed AgentCore Deployment

Production deployment using AWS Bedrock AgentCore Runtime with VPC Private Mode:
- ✅ Bedrock AgentCore Runtime hosting Strands Agent
- ✅ Custom Code Interpreter (ECR + ALB + Fargate)
- ✅ 100% private network (VPC endpoints, no public internet)

**Get Started**: [`./managed-agentcore/`](./managed-agentcore/) | 📖 [Managed AgentCore README](./managed-agentcore/README.md)

### Web UI Deployment

Browser-based interface for non-technical users:
- ✅ Upload data, review plans, download reports from the browser
- ✅ Two workflows: **outer loop** (long-form multi-agent analysis) + **inner loop** ([Data Q&A](./deep-insight-web/DATA_QA.md) — fast Text2SQL chat on the same CSV)
- ✅ Korean/English language support
- ✅ Two deployment options: VPN CIDR (internal) or CloudFront + Cognito (external)
- ✅ Optional: Ops dashboard for job tracking and email notifications

**Get Started**: [`./deep-insight-web/`](./deep-insight-web/)

## Deployment Options

| | Self-Hosted | Managed AgentCore | Web UI |
|---|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Setup Time | ~10 minutes | ~45 minutes | ~15 minutes (after Managed) |
| Agent Hosting | Local/EC2 | Bedrock AgentCore Runtime | Same as Managed |
| Code Execution | Local Python | Custom Code Interpreter (Fargate) | Same as Managed |
| Network | Your choice | 100% Private VPC | VPN CIDR or CloudFront + Cognito |
| Best For | Development, Testing | Production, Enterprise | Non-technical Users |

## Evaluation

The eval harness turns "did this change make Deep Insight better?" into numbers. It runs fixed analysis requests against the deployed runtime, then scores each run on:
- ✅ **Completion** — the report, citations and validation files were all produced
- ✅ **Numeric accuracy** — numbers in the report match the computed values, the source CSV and a pandas answer key
- ✅ **Analysis quality** — an LLM judge (a different model family on Bedrock) checks each requested item was answered and compares reports with the baseline
- ✅ **Cost & speed** — dollars per run (Bedrock prices), cache hit rate, duration, failed code executions

```bash
cd eval-harness   # setup: see the Eval Harness README
.venv/bin/python eval_runtime.py create                                            # once: a separate runtime for evals, so users aren't affected
.venv/bin/python run_eval.py --scenario moon_market_kr --repeat 3 --tag baseline   # run + grade
.venv/bin/python compare.py eval_results/baseline eval_results/my-change           # before vs after
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q                                                      # static checks, no AWS
```
