"""LLM judge for report quality: what the rule-based graders can't see.

The graders in graders/ check that numbers are right. They can't tell whether
a report answers the request: a report that only states total revenue
correctly passes every one of them. This module adds two model-graded checks:

  pointwise  one report + the request + a rubric → per-requirement status
             (met / partial / missing) and 1-5 scores on four criteria
  pairwise   the same request, a candidate report and a frozen baseline
             report → which is better, per criterion and overall. Judged
             twice with the order swapped; a verdict that flips with the
             order counts as a tie.

Pairwise is the primary signal for A/B: judges are better at "which of these
two" than at placing one report on an absolute scale. Pointwise gives an
absolute number when there is no baseline and feeds core_pass through
`judge_requirements_missing`.

The judge runs on a different model family than the agents (OpenAI models on
Amazon Bedrock, via the Converse API), so it isn't grading its own family's
writing. The response is constrained to a JSON schema (outputConfig.textFormat)
and validated again with pydantic. Settings live in judge.yaml.
