"""LLM fact checker: does the report state the answer-key facts correctly?

Rules can find "937,520원" next to "중구", but they can't read whether "중구가
매출 1위" means the full period (wrong: 중구 is 3rd) or week 2 (right). This
module lets a model do the reading and keeps the arithmetic in code:

  1. extract    The model gets the answer-key fact definitions WITHOUT the
                answers, plus the report, and lists every statement the
                report makes about each fact: verbatim quote, stated value,
                unit, the period/filter the report gives, and whether that
                scope matches the definition. Hiding the answers keeps the
                model from reading what it expects to see.
  2. compare    Code checks each statement: the quote must occur in the
                report, the number must occur in the quote, and the value
                is compared with graders/numbers.matches (display rounding,
                ratio shown as %), a ranking by position, a relation as is.
  3. adjudicate Statements code can't settle (scope unclear, unit or number
                doubtful) and every mismatch go back to the model, this
                time with the answer and the paragraph around the quote.

A mismatch is `wrong_confirmed` only when code and the adjudicator both say
wrong; that fails core_pass. Disagreements are `needs_review` and don't.
Settings are shared with judge.py (judge.yaml): same model, different family
from the agents.

For every fact above, find every statement in the report about that quantity, including in tables, figure captions and summaries, and list each one separately.

- value: any number the report gives for the quantity, right or wrong, even rounded or in other units (1.2만원, 16.4M). A different number for the same quantity is still a statement about it.
- ranking: any rank the report gives a name: "중구가 매출 1위", "1위는 광진구", "3rd", "top region". A list in rank order ("중구, 중랑구, 양천구 순") is one statement per name, with its position as the number and the same quote.
- relation: any comparison the report makes for it ("평균 이상", "below average", "고AOV 지역").
- percent vs percentage points: if the report writes %p (or "points") for this quantity, set unit to percent_point.
- scope: write the period and filter the report gives for this statement in stated_scope. If it gives none, write 'unstated'; that means the whole dataset, so compare it with the fact's scope as such. Use 'different' only when the report clearly talks about another period or subset (another week, a filtered group, a different base).
- A statement can belong to several facts (e.g. "중구 937,520원으로 3위" is both the region's revenue and its rank): list it under each.
- Skip facts the report doesn't mention. Don't list numbers about other quantities."""
